Questions


Intro - part 1
  * about me, slush pool
  * quick intoduction of merge mining (2-3 sentences)
  * "The act of using work done on one blockchain on more than one chain, using Auxiliary POW." [03]


Bitcoin
  * no desc. required


Namecoin
  * altcoin
  * first fork of bitcoin
  * additional value - distributed ecoure DNS (breaks Zooko's triangle) [01]


How Bitcoin Minig Works - part 2


Block
  * header + transaction
  * IMG: structure

Block Header
  * 80 Bytes
  * same structure Bitcoin & Namecoin
  * IMG: structure

Blockchain
  * chain of blocks
  * block header contains hash of previous block header
  * ?? IMG: structure

Mining - part 3

Proof of Work
  * "A proof of work is a piece of data which was difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce so as to satisfy certain requirements" [02]
  * example hashing "Hello world!" [02]
  * ctyrlisty
  * grains of sand
  * bitcoin POW - header hash

Aux POW
  * !! definitions
  * Auxiliry POW
  * second way to proove your work
  * "This is the way that merged mining can exist; it is the relationship between two blockchains for one to trust the other's work as their own and accept AuxPOW blocks." [03]

Bitcoin (Merged Mining) Coinbase
  * input of first transaction in block
  * !! very special tx
  * "The first transaction in a block, called the coinbase transaction, must have exactly one input, called a coinbase." [04][05]
  * must be shortest than 100 Bytes
  * contains merge mining data - prove work on specific block in other chain

Principle of Aux POW
  * !! IMG, most important part


Namecoin Block
  * IMG: structure
